</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Deflection is a powerful, versatile calculator for beams, 2D trusses, and 2D frames.  The interface is simple and intuitive, and the graphical output is state-of-the-art.  In addition to reaction, shear, bending moment, and deflection results, Deflection also computes internal shear and bending stress along the cross section and along the beam.

2D FRAME AND TRUSS EDITOR

The 2D editor is seamlessly integrated with the beam editor.  Draw arbitrary frame and truss structures and apply loads and constraints using the same simple interface as for beams.  You can visualize results directly within the 2D editor, or you can select a beam and get additional insights. 

INTERNAL STRESSES

Obtain internal bending and shear stress diagrams in addition to shear, bending, and deflection diagrams.  The internal stresses can be visualized along the length of the beam as well as along the vertical axis of the cross section using the beam editor.

CROSS SECTION EDITOR

Edit built-in cross sections.  Moment of inertia and area values are automatically calculated and applied to the rest of the beam calculations.

MORE FEATURES

‚Ä¢ The built-in database contains more data for your reference and convenience.
‚Ä¢ Apply beam self-weight optionally
‚Ä¢ Unlimited design files
‚Ä¢ Quick-start templates
