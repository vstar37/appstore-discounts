</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Juicy Realm is a roguelike game with fruits as enemies. It is set in a world in which the line between animals and plants is blurred. It began with the tipping of the food-chain, which forced the humans to establish an outpost and begin an investigation in the region where the first species of mutated plants was discovered. The military has prepared a vast number of powerful weapons, with you leading the vanguard forces to wage this long war.

Subverted Order
‚ÄúMany years later, when the humans watch as the plants climb up to the top of the food chain, they will be reminded of their own naivety and arrogance‚Ä¶‚Äù
Only when all the plants started to evolve into animals, growing limbs and becoming sentient, did the humans realize the threat of those photosynthetic-lifeforms. No one knows how they achieved the state of evolution that took animal lifeforms millions of years to reach in such a short amount of time, and no one knows their ultimate objective. The only thing known for sure is that the humans now face the greatest challenge since they climbed up to the top of the food chain.

Gameplay
As the first explorers of this unknown region, you must strive to venture deep into the enemy hive, defeat all kinds of fruits and arm yourself with various equipment, as well as upgrade yourself with the resources you find in your way.

Game Features
-Rougelite elements such as random terrains, loot drops, and monsters
-Hundreds of special and bizarre weapons and items
-Loads of unique mod enemies and bosses
-10 characters in the roster with unique skills and abilities
-Unique artstyle with rich details

</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  A story-driven experience about two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish.

ABOUT THIS GAME
Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live, all the way from the very beginning... but only in their patients' heads.

Due to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath. Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn‚Äôt.

This particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.

And Johnny's last wish is, of course... to go to the moon.

MORE DETAILS
"To the Moon", a story-driven RPG with pixel graphics, was originally developed six years ago for PC by Canadian producer Kan Gao and Freebird Games, his indie game studio.Rights to develop and publish the remastered mobile version of "To the Moon" were acquired by X.D. Network Inc.

  ICEY is a 2D side-scrolling action game. As you follow the narrator's omnipresent voice, you will see through ICEY's eyes and learn the truth about her world. 

‚ÄúAlright, you caught me! This ISN'T really just a simple 2D action game, and you WON'T be seeing through ICEY's eyes... NOR will you learn the truth about her world." says the narrator. 

‚ÄúICEY is a Meta game in disguise. The narrator will constantly urge you in one direction, but you must ask, "Why? Why am I following his directions? Why can't I learn the truth about this world and ICEY's purpose here?" Fight against his tyranny, and uncover what's really going on for yourself!

In fact, you can become ICEY, and let loose the shackles of your own identity. You are ICEY, and ICEY is you... if you want it that way. Feel free to keep hold of your own self, if you wish.

</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Moncage is a stunning vignette puzzle adventure developed by Optillusion. 

The game takes place inside a mysterious cube, with each side of the cube housing a unique world: be it an old factory, a light tower, an amusement park, or a church, etc. At first sight, they may seem random and unrelated, but upon closer look, you will become mesmerized by the subtle and intricate ways of how these worlds connect‚Ä¶  

„ÄêSolve Puzzles with Mind-Boggling Optical Illusions„Äë
Use your imagination and spare no brain cells to find the connection and pinpoint every possible interaction between different sides of the cube, then watch as the magic unfold in front of you.

„ÄêCollect All Photos to Unveil the Story„Äë
Behind the puzzles, there lies a story with a surprising twist for the player to uncover. Collect the photos from obscure corners and angles to reveal the underlying story, one photo at a time.

„ÄêGet Unstuck with Thoughtful Hints„Äë
There is a multitude of guidance systems to help prevent players from getting stuck. Focus can be activated to highlight the key items to the solution, while hint texts are available to provide further clarity. And, if all else fails, video walkthroughs can be unlocked as the ultimate safety plan. 

„ÄêProve Your Puzzle-Solving Skills with Medals„Äë
There are a total of 15 achievements in the game, each corresponding with a Medal that has been crafted with a uniquely stunning design. A complete collection of the 15 Medals could be the perfect evidence to attest to your master puzzle-solving skills~
