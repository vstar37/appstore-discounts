[Game Starts Now—!!]

Lovely girls
or rhythmic music?
If there’s a place for you to have them both…
It must be the paradise of parkour & rhythm game  — Muse Dash!!

Huh?! Not your forte? It doesn’t matter!
Who says you must have a strong sense of rhythm to win?
Avoid is also a valid option (?)
As long as you have 100% of passion, courage, and… love for lovely girls~
Rhythm and fight won’t be an issue

[Gameplay]
Dance to the music and beat enemies in the air and on the ground. Also, watch out for the obstacles!!
What an easy, beginner-friendly rhythm game
