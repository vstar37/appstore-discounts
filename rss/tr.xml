</ul><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  ## Top productivity app in 136 countries. More than 2 million satisfied paying users. Featured in Apple's "Amazing Apps" TV commercial.
## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. 
## Over 1,500,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  

"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you."‚Äî The New York Times 

"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you."‚Äî Business Insider

If you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what‚Äôs more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. 

The sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.

Stay focused, Be present!

NOTICE
‚Ä¢ Forest is compatible with iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and can be used across these iOS devices with a one-time purchase. The full app with the aforementioned features is available on iPhone and iPad; on Apple Watch you can view live planting session and today‚Äôs focus stats. To download or unlock a non-iOS version, it requires a separate purchase. By logging into the same account, your data can be synchronized across all platforms.
‚Ä¢ Due to iOS limitations, the Allow List feature is only available on iOS/iPadOS 16 or above. If you‚Äôre using a device running iOS/iPadOS 15 or below, your tree will wither when you leave Forest during a planting session.
‚Ä¢ Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.
‚Ä¢ There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team. Thank you for your support!
